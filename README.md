# Graph Diameter Calculation

This project calculates the diameter of random graphs using Dijkstra's Algorithm and measures the execution time to analyze its complexity.

## Features

- Generates random graphs with adjustable density.
- Calculates diameter using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Compares execution time with theoretical complexity O(VÂ² log V).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `random`, `time`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `heapq`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
